# Synthetic-Data-Generation
The goal of this project is to develop and implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating synthetic data. The synthetic data can mimic real-world data distribution while addressing challenges like data scarcity, privacy concerns, or class imbalance.

In many machine learning applications, acquiring large amounts of high-quality data can be challenging due to privacy, time, or resource constraints. Synthetic data generation is a potential solution that can augment existing datasets, particularly in fields like healthcare, finance, or autonomous driving, where collecting real data may be limited or restricted.

This project explores the use of GANs to generate realistic synthetic data. A GAN consists of two neural networks—the Generator and the Discriminator—that are trained simultaneously in a competitive setting. The Generator creates fake data instances, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. Over time, the Generator learns to produce data that is indistinguishable from the real data.
